[2025-07-13] Feature Add: AI Video Surveillance Webpage
====================================================================

Summary:  
Added a new webpage titled "AI Video Surveillance" based on  
marketing materials provided by CES. The page is fully responsive,  
branded, and styled with a mobile-first approach.

File(s) Added:  
- Front-End/video-surveillance.html  
- Front-End/css/video-surveillance.css  
- Front-End/images/video-surveillance/  

Details:

  and subheading.

  layout for desktop and mobile.  
- Added a bottom decorative banner with branding visuals.  
- Modal functionality added for product pop-up details.  
- Custom styles isolated to video-surveillance.css.  
- Global branding styles reused from styles.css.

print flyer, extending marketing efforts and showcasing  
CES’s camera and surveillance product offerings.

====================================================================
[2025-07-16] Feature Add: CTA Section + Reusable Consultation Form
====================================================================

Summary:  
Added a new call-to-action (CTA) section to the AI Video Surveillance
webpage and developed a reusable, dynamically populated consultation 
contact form. This enhances lead generation while unifying form handling 
logic across the site.

File(s) Added:  
- Front-End/contact-form.html  
- Front-End/css/contact-forms.css  

File(s) Modified:  
- Front-End/video-surveillance.html  

Details:  
- Implemented a visually styled CTA section at the bottom of video-
surveillance.html above the footer tombstone.  
- CTA includes a headline, supporting text, and a button linked to the new 
dynamic contact form.  
- Created contact-form.html with full Keap/Infusionsoft integration using a 
legacy endpoint (form xid: a1087e9c3bd1f0d3fafcfb1f88a3bbcd).  
- Integrated dynamic behavior using JavaScript to read URL parameters (e.g., ?reason=video).  
  - This updates the form title, supporting text, and preloads the message field.  
- Developed a new CSS file (contact-forms.css) to unify styling across all contact
 forms while preserving CES branding and layout standards.

Reason:  
To enable scalable, trackable consultation lead capture across multiple pages while 
simplifying future form reuse. This also solves the issue of categorizing and pre-tagging
 contact reasons for easier review within Keap.
