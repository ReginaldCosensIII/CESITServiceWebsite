feat: Establish V1 homepage foundation with new design

This commit implements the complete, multi-section V1 design for the homepage, based on the new creative direction.

The implementation includes three core sections and establishes a robust, responsive foundation for future development.

Key Accomplishments:

- **Modern Header:** A multi-part header featuring a top bar with company branding and contact information, and a separate, full-width navigation bar. The header is fully responsive, collapsing to a clean mobile view with a functional hamburger menu.

- **Dynamic Hero Section:** A new hero section with a full-width background image, a gradient overlay for text readability, and a content structure featuring a headline, blockquote, and call-to-action button. The hero is responsive, defaulting to a clean, lightweight background on mobile to prioritize performance and readability.

- **Engaging "Self-Assessment" Section:** A new section below the hero designed to engage users. It features a high-impact call-to-action banner with a modern, overlapping "card" effect on desktops, and a responsive multi-column list for displaying questions.

- **Professional Footer:** A completely redesigned three-column footer with a dark, brand-consistent theme. It includes sections for social media, detailed contact/hours information, and business partners. It is fully responsive and stacks neatly on mobile devices.

Architectural Principles:

- Built using a mobile-first responsive design philosophy.
- Utilizes modern HTML5 and CSS3, including Flexbox and Grid for robust layouts.
- Establishes a clean, maintainable, and scalable foundation for the rest of the website.
