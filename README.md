# CES IT Service Website (cesitservice.com)

This repository contains the official static codebase for the Computer Enhancement Systems, Inc. (CES) website, serving Frederick, MD, and the surrounding metro area.

## Project Overview

This project is a complete rebuild and modernization of the public-facing website for CES IT Service. The goal is to create a fast, secure, and responsive static website that clearly communicates the company's core services, builds trust, and generates leads.

The project is being developed in phases, with the `main` branch always reflecting the current live, production version of the site.

### Core Features

* **Modern, Responsive Design:** Built mobile-first, with a modern video hero section on the homepage.
* **Static Site:** All pages are static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring maximum security and performance.
* **Service-Oriented:** Clear, detailed pages for Managed IT, AI Video Surveillance, and VoIP Solutions.
* **Lead Generation:** Contact forms are integrated with the Keap CRM for efficient lead management.
* **CES Tech Tips (In Development):** A new blog section is being developed to provide value, improve SEO, and establish thought leadership.

## Branching & Deployment Workflow

This repository uses a professional Git workflow adapted to the client's specific security and deployment requirements.

### 1. The `main` Branch (Production Mirror)

The `main` branch is a **1-to-1 mirror** of the code currently live on the `cesitservice.com` production server.

* **DO NOT PUSH DIRECTLY TO `main`.**
* This branch only receives code when a feature is completed, approved, and ready for deployment.

### 2. Feature Branches (All Development)

All new work (e.g., bug fixes, new pages, the blog) **must** be done on a separate feature branch.

* **Branch Naming:** `feature/your-feature-name` (e.g., `feature/ces-tech-tips`)
* **Process:**
    1.  Create your new branch from `main`: `git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature`
    2.  Make all your commits to this branch.
    3.  Push the branch to GitHub to back it up: `git push -u origin feature/my-new-feature`

### 3. Manual Deployment Process (Client Requirement)

Per client security policy, this repository is **not** connected to the production server via CI/CD. Deployment is a manual handoff.

**To Prepare Files for Production:**
1.  Ensure all approved work has been merged into the `main` branch.
2.  Prepare a clean copy (or `.zip` archive) of all files and folders from the `main` branch.
3.  **CRITICAL:** Before handoff, you **must delete** all Git-related and non-production files from this copy. This includes:
    * `.git/` (the hidden folder)
    * `.gitignore`
    * `README.md` (this file)
    * Any other test or config files (e.g., `.vscode/`)
4.  Hand off the clean files to the System Administrator for manual upload to the production server.

## Server-Side File Management (`.gitignore`)

This repository *only* tracks the static site code you are responsible for. Several files and folders that exist on the production server are **intentionally ignored** via `.gitignore` to prevent conflicts and respect the separation of concerns.

* `ipblock.txt`: A live server configuration file managed by the System Admin. It is *not* part of this website project.
* `remoteportal/` & `HelpDesk/`: Legacy ASP applications that live on the same server but are separate projects.

### CES Tech Tips Blog (Eleventy SSG)

The static HTML files for the blog posts (e.g., `/blog/post-name/index.html`) are generated by a **separate Eleventy (11ty) project**.

* **Purpose:** This separate repo acts as a "build tool" or Static Site Generator (SSG) to make writing blog posts fast and easy.
* **Repository:** `[PASTE LINK TO YOUR ELEVENTY GITHUB REPO HERE]`
* **Workflow:**
    1.  Write and develop new blog posts in the Eleventy project.
    2.  Run the Eleventy build command (`npm run build`) to generate the final static HTML files.
    3.  Copy the *output* files (from the Eleventy project's `/dist` or `/_site` folder) into the `feature/ces-tech-tips` branch of *this* repository.
